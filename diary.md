Cannot do:
- move the camera along in the specific place in the background
- gravity of the character (jump, fall if no object is underneath)
- idle animation (face the same directions it moved, 2 sprite sheets for idling left and right)
- how to implement the animation frames when jumping up, falling down and pressing A or D

Solution for idle animations: if the last key pressed was .., then it sets to false, and displayes the idle animation when its xyvelocity is 0;
